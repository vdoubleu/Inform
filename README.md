# INFORM

A next generation newsfeed.
Inform is an online, crowd run news platform that collates and displays the most relevant and pressing issues from around your vicinity.

Inform has several defining features to make for a great user experience. Articles are automatically sorted by relevance based on recency and its like/dislike count. Articles are also displayed based on how close you are to the posted location so only articles relevant to your location are posted. 

This app was built using ReactJS and Redux as well as Bootstrap for many of the user interface components. The core of the Python Flask REST API was generated using Swagger. This allowed for easy generation of documentation as the REST API is designed. Interactions with the MYSQL database were doing through Python as well. All the backend logic was also done using Python.

User authentication was delegated to third party authentication services like Google Sign In to guarantee the confidentiality and security of users and their information.
