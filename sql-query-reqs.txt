This is the layout of the database i was envisioning

main table
id    title    body     catagory    author-name   date-posted    foreign-key(for likes and dislikes)   



the foreign key will lead to another table storing the likes and dislikes
id    name     opinion(either -1, 0, 1 for dislike, no opinion, like)


These are the sql queries i need written out

update/add opinion
given an opinion, an article id, and the name of the user, add/change the opinion for that article

get opinion
given an article id, and the name of the user, return that users opinion of that article if it exists

add article
given a title, a body, a catagory, an author-name and date-posted, add the entry to the main table

get article
given a title, a body, a catagory, an author-name and date-posted, return the entire entry. So, id, title, body, catagory, author-name, data-posted. No need to return likes and dislikes
